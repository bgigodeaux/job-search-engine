# üß† Manatal Recommendation Engine

This project is an **AI-powered recommendation engine** for matching job descriptions with top candidates.  
It combines **LLMs for feature engineering**, **hybrid search (semantic + keyword)**, and a **Streamlit webapp** for interactive exploration.

---

## ‚ö° Features

- Manage **raw candidates** and **raw jobs** (`app/data/` as JSON)
- **LLM-driven feature engineering**:
  - infer skills, seniority, summaries for candidates
  - extract skills, experience level, and normalized descriptions for jobs
- **Semantic + rule-based search**:
  - Keyword Search: candidates are filtered on hard criteria (skills, years)
  - Vector Search: then ranked by vector similarity
- **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive browsing and search
- **FastAPI backend** for programmatic access
- For scaling **Chroma vector store**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Clone & install
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.  
With [direnv](https://direnv.net/) configured, run:

```bash
direnv reload
```

This will install all dependencies from pyproject.toml

### 2. Environment
Make sure the `.env` file contains a valid `MISTRAL_API_KEY` 


### 3. Start APIs & UI

- UI: Streamlit
- API: FastAPI Backend

```bash
docker compose up --build 
```

Then visit:
- Swagger docs: http://localhost:8000/docs ![image](extras/api-docs.png)
- Health check: http://localhost:8000/health



Endpoints:
- POST /process-candidates ‚Üí processes raw candidates into embeddings
- POST /recommend ‚Üí returns ranked candidates for a job
